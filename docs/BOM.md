# Bill of Materials

The hardware list for the project can be found [here](./README.md). Here's some configurations to consider:

- **Raspberry Pi Zero setup**: [BOM here](../bom/bom_zero_w.csv)
- **Raspberry Pi setup**: [BOM Here](../bom/bom_3b.csv)

## IMPORTANT

For those going for a non-Zero setup, only the 3B is currently supported. Please observe the hardware requirements outlined by the BOM links listed above.
